This repository demonstrates a common concurrency bug in Swift involving asynchronous network requests and how to fix it using proper memory management techniques. The bug occurs when the completion handler of an asynchronous operation tries to access a deallocated object, leading to a crash. The solution involves using weak references to ensure the completion handler doesn't retain the view controller beyond its lifecycle.
